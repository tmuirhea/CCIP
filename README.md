# Continuously Calculated Impact Point or CCIP

## Project Name: CCIP 
CCIP is a calculation from a weapon's sighting system which predicts its payload's point of impact. This constinuously updated calculation is used for displaying information to a person's HUD or in our case visualize the tracking of a payload. 

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) 
- Visually see tracking of destination object / payloads trajectory

#### Measurements
1. Average time it takes to deliver a payload in response to a new target point nearby (Need to test/simulate, What are good response times?)
2. Accuracy of payload when we add in gusty wind

Add more stuff etc.
